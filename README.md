# mock-homepage

This is a responsive homepage based on a design spec. The main purpose of this project was to practice responsive web design using CSS media queries. The mockup images for each screen size can be found in the `images` folder.

## Lessons Learned

- Loading custom font families locally instead of through a CDN.
- Using clip paths to shape irregular polygons for background images.
